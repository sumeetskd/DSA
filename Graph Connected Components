What it means for a graph to be connected. 
It including binary trees, and emphasize that even disconnected portions can be considered as separate graphs. 
The concept of connected components is introduced to address this. A graph with ten nodes and eight edges, which is divided into four components. 
They explain that in algorithms such as traversal algorithms, it is important to use a visited array to ensure that all connected portions of the graph are explored. 
The traversal algorithm is explained using the example graph, where each component is visited in a sequential manner. 
The speaker highlights the importance of running the traversal algorithm from each unvisited node to cover all components.

graphs can be connected through different componets:
how to visit -> using traversal algorithm and a visited array

for(int i = 1; i<graph.length; i++){
	if(!visit[i]){
		traversal(i);
	}
}

visit[] array is initially filled with 0.
->As the traversal of nodes continues it will be filled it 1(to mark it as visited)
